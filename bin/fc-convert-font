    Usage: {$*PROGRAM.basename} <font files to convert, with suffix> [options...]

    Converts fonts between PostScript and TrueType or OpenType formats:

      X.pfb => X.ttf
      X.ttf => X.t1a and X.afm
      X.otf => X.t1a and X.afm

    Options:
      in-dir=D  - Where D is a directory to search for font files.

      out-dir=D - Where D is a directory to put output products
                    (default: '.'). 

    Note: On input the user may list font files to be converted and also 
    name an input directory to be searched.  If any font basenames are 
    the same, only the first one found is selected. The search order is: 
    input args, then the optional 'in-dir' (including all its subdirectories).
