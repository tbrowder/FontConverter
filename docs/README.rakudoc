=head1 NAME

B<FontConverter> - Enables conversion between TrueType, OpenType, and PostScript Type 1 fonts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use FontConverter;
fc-convert-font Times-Roman.pfb # OUTPUT: Times-Roman.ttf
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<FontConverter> provides tools to convert PostScript Type 1 binary
font files to TrueType as well as conversion from TrueType or OpenType to PostScript Type 1. 
It requires the following system programs to be installed:

=begin item
fontforge (and its Python components)

To convert PostScript Type 1 to TrueType
(X.pfb to X.ttf).
=end item

=begin item
ttf2ufm

To convert TrueType or OpenType to PostScript Type 1
(X.ttf or X.otf to X.pfb, X.pfa, and X.afm).
=end item

Other font-related system programs:

=item pfbtopfa - converts .pfb to .pfa 
=item pdffonts - info on fonts in a pdf doc
=item pf2afm   - produces an afm file from a PostScript font
=item printafm - shows metrics from PostScript
=item showttf  - provides details of a TrueType or OpenType font

=head1 Motivation

The author has been creating Raku modules to convert old PostScript-generating
programs (whose products were then converted to PDF)
to direct PDF-generation. In the process, he wants to convert old
PostScript Type 1 fonts he bought for special projects to TrueType.
